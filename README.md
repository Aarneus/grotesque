# grotesque

A Clojure(script) library for text generation.

Uses a context-free grammar similar to [Tracery](https://tracery.io/) but with added 
[state conditions and effects on rules](https://emshort.blog/2019/11/29/storylets-you-want-them/).

*Still a work-in-progress.*

## Principles
- Full support for both Clojure and ClojureScript
- Compatibility with Tracery (at least to some extent)
- Purely functional and data-driven
- Extensible

## Usage
This is still a WIP.

More documentation to come.

## Features to be done for 1.0
- [x] Rule parsing
- [x] Text generation
- [x] Unit testing
- [x] Effects and conditions
- [x] Schema validation
- [x] Rule picking options
- [x] Error logging
