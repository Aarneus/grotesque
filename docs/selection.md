## Rule selection
The value of `:selector-fn` in the grammar map is used for selecting a rule.  
The function takes three arguments, the current grammar, the selected for rule head and a vector of valid rule bodies.  
It returns a new grammar with the selected rule body `assoc`:ed under the `:selected` key:  
```clojure
(defn selector-fn [grammar head bodies]
  (assoc grammar :selected (rand-nth bodies)))
```

The default selector function above just picks a rule at random.

Note that you can use the `:data` key in the grammar to store metadata about the rules.  
For example, you can save the rule id of every rule selected and prefer those that have been selected least:  
```clojure
(grotesque/set-selector grammar (fn [old-grammar head bodies]
                                  (let [selected (->> bodies
                                                      (sort-by #(-> old-grammar :data :times-selected ((:id %))))
                                                      first)]
                                    (-> old-grammar
                                        (update-in [:data :times-selected (:id selected)] #(if (nil? %) 1 (inc %)))
                                        (assoc :selected selected)))))
```

You can also make metaselectors.  
If you wanted to e.g. have a characterâ€™s name appear in the text, 
you could generate a rule for the character that has their name on it.  
But you could also make a selector that does the job for you:  
```clojure
(-> grammar
    (grotesque/set-selector (fn [old-grammar head bodies]
                              (let [names (-> old-grammar :data :names)]
                                (if (contains? names head)
                                  (assoc old-grammar :selected {:id :meta, :text [(get names head)]})
                                  (assoc old-grammar :selected (rand-nth bodies))))))
    (assoc-in [:data :names] {:hero "Ilsa", :villain "Rodric", :donor "Mustiff"}))
```
Note that rule heads are keywords without dots.  
So `:story` is a valid head but `:dance.time` is not.  
This is because it would interfere with modifiers, [a planned feature](future.md).
