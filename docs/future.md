## Notes on future features
The foremost feature missing from Grotesque at the moment is pattern matching.  
A second important missing feature is Tracery-style modifiers. 

### Pattern matching
This will allow the user to specify *wildcard* variables.  
These would be parts of conditions and effects that would be matched with an existing variable when the rule was selected.  

A partial example of pattern matching:
```
{:rules {:event ["#X# punches #Y#!" 
                 :when.X.relationship.Y.hostile 
                 :set.Y.relationship.X.hostile]}
 :data  {:jack {:relationship {:john :hostile}}
         :john {:relationship {:jack :neutral}}}}
```
In this example the `X` and `Y` are the wildcards.  
When checking for valid rules, this rule will check if there is any combination of valid,
 different variables that will fit these requirements and inject them into the given positions.

In this example, `X` would match with `:jack` and `Y` would match with `:john`.  
Therefore, before the conditions were checked the rule body would be morphed into the following form:
```
["#jack# punches #john#!"
 :when.jack.relationship.john.hostile
 :set.john.relationship.jack.hostile]
```
The rule itself would of course remain unchanged and ready to match different variables next time.

### Modifiers
These should match the standards set by Tracery.  
Basically these are middleware functions that take the output of the generated text and modify it somehow.

An example would be e.g. capitalization of the first letter:
```
{:name   ["Lisa" "Tom" "Marie"]
 :animal ["wombat" "giraffe" "bear"]
 :home   ["#name# the #animal.capitalize# lives here."]}
```
Which would then output:
```
Tom the Wombat lives here.
Lisa the Bear lives here.
Marie the Giraffe lives here.
```
This would allow the user much more control over the generation.

### Possible other future features
Other future features after 1.0 and the ones above could include:
- Optimizations
- Sample project (NaNoGenMo 2020?)
- Visualization
- Cookbook of possible effects, conditions and selectors
- Support for interop from Java/JavaScript
